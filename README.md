# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning


## Instructions

This project involves implementing various classification algorithms for rainfall prediction. The algorithms used include Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The models are evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and LogLoss.

## About the Data

The dataset used for this project contains weather observations from 2008 to 2017. It includes various weather metrics such as temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and more. The target variable is 'RainTomorrow,' indicating whether it will rain the next day.

## Importing Data

The weather data is imported from the 'Weather_Data.csv' file.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves one-hot encoding categorical variables and converting the target variable to binary form.

## Train and Test Data Split

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function.

## Train Models and Evaluate

### Linear Regression

A Linear Regression model is trained and evaluated.

### KNN
